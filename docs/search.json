Big Picture: What Story Are We Telling?\nIn this project, we will be using SQL to summarize a month of U.S. flight activity and then build visualizations using R to answer:\n\nWhich airlines suffer the worst delays?\nHow do flight volumes vary across days of the week?\nWhich airports are delay and cancellation “hot spots”?\nHow do daily flight counts evolve over time?\n\nAir travel demand is highly uneven across the week, a small number of carriers and airports experience extreme delays, and cancellations are concentrated at major hubs where disruptions ripple through the entire network."
